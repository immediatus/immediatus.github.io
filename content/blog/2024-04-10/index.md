&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 2 well-defined processes known as: [scientific method<sup>[1]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) and [engineering design process<sup>[2]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_design_process) but both of them have a similar structure, and can be generalized to process in the [pic. 2](#pic_2).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the important part of engineering [\#mindset](/tags/mindset/) is the ability to <mark>generalize</mark> problems (applying the Generalization Principle). The process in the [pic. 2](#pic_2) already generalized and known as the process described in the [TRIZ<sup>[3]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) method. Reasonable mapping of each stage of scientific method and engineering design process to generalized one is in the ([table 1](#tbl_1)).

**Note:** *Value of principles that knowledge of them allow to avoid memorization of facts.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;  Generalized mapping of stages to methods is simplified and at some point of view sound reasonable, but details are the most complicated part and this is exactly a place where [\#mindset](/tags/mindset/) makes a difference. [\#Mindset](/tags/mindset/) is about possibility at any point in the [Engineering Mindset (#1)](/blog/2024-03-12/#pic_1) to define the sequence of steps to the goal by choosing the right method (sequence of stages/steps) and able to evaluate quality (performance) of it. Quality evaluation is another important part of the problem definition: how to be sure that the defined sequence of stages lead to the goal with the shortest path and solution is complete. And the next important principle is defining criteria for complete solution (Reverse planning method - start with what needs to be achieved and then work back through each step until it meets current problem state).
