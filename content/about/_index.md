**Yuriy Polyulya** has been a Software Engineer since 2002 and all the time up to now is working in the area of distributed computing with specialization in self-optimized systems.  Same time interested in understanding the theoretical part of engineering work, especially on identifying thinking algorithms in time of solving engineering problems to find a way to describe and optimize this process.

#### Area of interest:

1. Distributed systems and related scientific areas: Systems Theory, Optimization Theory, Game Theory, Collective behavior, Evolution and Adaptation;
2. Engineering principles and Functional/Object oriented design, various programming languages: Java, Scala, Python, Rust;
3. Invention engineering: TRIZ and ARIZ, Concept-Knowledge design theory.
